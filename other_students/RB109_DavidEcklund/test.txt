I'll just put in my quick thoughts... 
If you passed the 109 and feel comfortable with the material in 120, you should be set. By comparison to 109, I found the 120 exam more straightforward. Less code analysis (although there is definitely some) and more explaining concepts.
For each concept in the study guide, make sure you can explain it in your own words and have some good code examples ready.
