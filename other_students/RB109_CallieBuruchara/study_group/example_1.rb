# interview level of code  questions?
# level 6 kyu hard to trust, because sometimes it's too hard
# or too easy
# try to do level 6 or level 5 kyu

# interview doesn't do optimizing code for speed or real world problems
# should feel confident going into the interview
# practice in interview conditions

# block is code right after a method invocation

# loop is a method invocation
# while is a key word --> KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
# |var| is a block parameter
# local variables initialized in outer scope are not available
# in method definitions

# say block scope vs. inner scope of method definition
# in the interview, read the error message, explain what happened
# and THEN fix it

# variable shadowing doesn't happen with method definition
# because method def can't access in outer scope anyhow (only
# if something is passed in as a parameter)
