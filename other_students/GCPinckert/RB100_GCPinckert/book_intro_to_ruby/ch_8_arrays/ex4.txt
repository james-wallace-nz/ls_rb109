Exercise 4:
What does each method return in the following example?

arr = [15, 7, 18, 5, 12, 8, 5, 1]

1. arr.index(5)
   returns 3, the index number for the element 5

2. arr.index[5]
   throws an error, NoMethodError for undefined method '[]' 
   (because index expects parentheses for it's arguments?)

3. arr[5]
   returns 8, the element in the array at index 5
