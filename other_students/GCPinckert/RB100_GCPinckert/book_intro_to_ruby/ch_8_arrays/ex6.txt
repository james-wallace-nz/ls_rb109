Exercise 6:
The following code results in the error message below:

names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan', 'margaret']
names['margaret'] = 'jody'

TypeError: no implicit conversion of String into Integer
  from (irb):2:in `[]='
  from (irb):2
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

What is the problem and how can it be fixed?

The problem is that we are using the actual value of the array
element to try and access that element when we should be
using the index number for the array element 'margaret'. Ruby throws
the error because it expects an integer (the index number) not a 
string (the element itself).

By replacing 'margaret' with the correct index number (3), the code
should run as expects:

names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan', 'margaret']
names[3] = 'jody'
