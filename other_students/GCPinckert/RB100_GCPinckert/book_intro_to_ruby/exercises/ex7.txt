Exercise 7:
What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?

An array consists of an ordered list, which can be accessed via index
number. A hash consists of a list of key/value pairs, which do not
have any inherent order. In a hash, values are accessed via the key
usually using bracket notation.

array = [0, 1, 2, 3]
# access via index 
array [1] #=> 1

hash = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }
# acces via key
hash[:one] # => 1
