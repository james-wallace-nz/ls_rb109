Exercise 5:
Why does the following code give the folllowing error when run?

def execute(block)
  block.call
end

execute { puts "Hello from inside the execute method!" }

block.rb1:in `execute': wrong number of arguments (0 for 1) (ArgumentError)
from test.rb:5:in `<main>'

The error message indicates there is a problem with the number of 
arguments when the execute method is called. This is because when the 
method is defined, the & operator is left off the "block" parameter to
indicate a block of code. Therefore, the program expects a different 
object as argument, which is does not find when execute is called and
passed a block.
