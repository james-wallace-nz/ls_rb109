Exercise 2:
What will the following program print to the screen? What will it
return?

def execute(&block)
  block # note: block is never activated with the .call method.
end

execute { puts "Hello from inside the execute method!" }

This program will not print anything to the screen because the block
is never run with the .call method. Though there is no output, a proc 
object is returned.
