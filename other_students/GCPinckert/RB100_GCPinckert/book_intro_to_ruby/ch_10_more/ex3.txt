Exercise 3:
What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

Exception handling is a way to build in certain and specific actions
to be taken when an exception is thrown during the running of a program.
It allows the program to display some kind of error message when it 
runs into an exception, and then continue to run as it normally would, 
instead of stopping.
