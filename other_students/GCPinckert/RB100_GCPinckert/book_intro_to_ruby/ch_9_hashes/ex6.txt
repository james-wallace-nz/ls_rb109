Exercise 6:
Given the following code, what's the difference between the two
hashes that were created?

x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}

In my_hash the key assigned to "some value" is a symbol data type 
called :x. In my_hash2 the key assigned to "some value" is variable
x, which has the string value "hi there".
