# Error message:
SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
  from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'

The error message indicates that while using irb, the user
accidentally typed a ')' where a '}' was expected. Aka, there
was an issue with the *syntax* of the code, not the *logic*. 

EDIT: (from solution)

May also indicate a bracket that doesn't have a closing bracket
following it.
