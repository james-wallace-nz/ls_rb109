# Exercise 11

Given the following method `spin_me`, will the returned string be the same object as the one passed in as an argument or a different object?

```ruby
def spin_me(str)
  str.split.each do |word|
    word.reverse!
  end.join(" ")
end

spin_me("hello world") # "olleh dlrow"
```

The returned string will be a different object than the one passed in as an argument. This is because the method `split` returns a new array, which is the object passed to the method `each`. `each` passes each element in the calling array into the block and assigns it to the block parameter `word`. The destructive method `reverse!` is called on each `word`, however this does not effect the original string passed in as argument, only the elements in the calling array. Finally, `join` is called on the returned array (in which the string word objects are reversed), which returns a new string object. This new string object is returned by the method. The original string `str` will not be modified.
