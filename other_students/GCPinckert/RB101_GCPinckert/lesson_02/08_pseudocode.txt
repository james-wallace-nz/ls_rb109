1. A method that returns the sum of two integers

CASUAL
Given two integers:

Validate that the two values are valid integers?
Save the value of one integer added to the other integer as the sum.
Return the sum.

FORMAL
START
# Given two integers
int_1 = integer one
int_2 = integer two

SET sum = int_1 + int_2
PRINT sum
END

2. A method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all
   those strings concatenated together

CASUAL
Given an array of strings:

Iterate over the collection of strings:
  - save the first element in the collection as a new variable
  - for each iteration, add the current element to the variable

After iterating through the collection, return the value of the variable

FORMAL
START
# Given an array of strings:
["string1", "string2", "string3"]

SET iterator = 1
SET total_strings = value within array of strings at space 1

WHILE iterator <= length of strings array
  total_strings = total_strings + value of array of strings at space "iterator"
  iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT total_strings
END

3. A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with
   every other element.

CASUAL
Given an array of integers

Set up a counter variable
Initialize an empty array variable
Iterate over the array of integers
  if the counter variable is odd:
    - add the array element to the previously initialized empty array
  otherwise
    - go to the next iteration
  Increment the counter variable

After iterating through the whole array, return the array the we initialized

FORMAL
Given an array of integers
[num1, num2, num3, num4]

SET iterator = 1
SET new_array = empty array

WHILE iterator < = length of integers array
  if iterator is odd
    new_array = new_array + value in integers array at space "iterator"
  else (iterator is even)
    go to next iteration
  
  iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT new_arrayE
END
