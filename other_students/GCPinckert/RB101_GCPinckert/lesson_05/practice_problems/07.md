Find the final values for `a` and `b` in the given code

```ruby
a = 2
b = [5, 8]
arr = [a, b]

arr[0] += 2
arr[1][0] -= a
```

| Line | Action | Object | Side Effect | Return Value | Return Value Used? |
| ---- | ------ | ------ | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| 1 | variable assignment | n/a | None | integer `2` | No |
| 2 | variable assignment | n/a | None | array `[5, 8]` | No | 
| 3 | variable assignment | n/a | None | nested array `[2, [5, 8]]` | No |
| 5 | element reference with array method `[]` | nested array `[2, [5, 8]]` | None | object at index 0 of the nested array (`2`, referenced by `a`) | Yes, passed to `+=` for reassignment |
| 5 | element reassignment `+=` | object at index 0 of nested array | Destructively modifies the top level array, breaks link between `arr[0]` and variable `a` | object assigned, `4` | No |
| 6 | element reference with array method `[]` | nested array `[2, [5, 8]]` | None | object at index 1 of nested array, `[5, 8]` (referenced by `b`) | Yes, passed to chained method `[]` |
| 6 | element reference with array method `[]` | sub-array `[5, 8]` (referenced by `b`) | None | object at index 0 of sub-array, `5` | Yes, passed to `-=` for reassignment |
| 6 | element reassignment `-=` | object at index 0 of sub-array, `5` | None | object assigned, `3` | No | 

The final value referenced by `a` in the code above is the integer `2`. The final value referenced by `b` is the modified sub-array `[3, 8]`. When we first initialize `arr`, `a` as a variable points to the same object in memory as `arr[0]` and `b` points to the same object as `arr[1]`. However, in line 5 we use element reassignment to increment the value referenced by `arr[0]` and `a`. This breaks the link between `a` and `arr[0]`. `arr[0]` now points to the newly assigned object, the integer `4`, while `a` continues to point to the original object in memory, the integer `2`. `b`, however, points to a collection of elements, so when we re-assign the object referenced by `arr[1][0]` we are modifying only the element of `b` referenced by `b[0]` and the collection `b` as a whole still references the same object in memory (an array). Because of this, `b` and `arr[1]` are still linked, and point to the same object, so any changes in `arr[1]` will also be reflected in `b`.
