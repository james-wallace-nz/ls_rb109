# Every named entity in Ruby has an object_id. This is a unique identifier for that object.

# It is often the case that two different things "look the same", but they can be different objects. The "under the hood" object referred to by a particular named-variable can change depending on what is done to that named-variable.

# In other words, in Ruby, all values are objects...but they are not always the same object.

# Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the flow of the code below:

# Wow, look at that. Even though we changed the values of our "outer" variables inside the method call, we still have the same values and the same object id's down here AFTER the method call as we had before it!

# This is because our method call accepts VALUES as arguments. The names we give to those values in the definition of our method are SEPARATE from any other use of those same names.

# We used the same names there for convenience (and admittedly to build some suspense and allow us to clarify this point). We could just as easily have called the first parameter of our method definition a_Fred instead of a_outer.

# The method gets the VALUES of the arguments we pass, but the parameter variables inside the method have no other relationship to those outside of the method. The names were coincidental, and confusing in a useful way.

# => "ugh ohhhhh"

# Our main method STILL has no access to variables that are defined inside of the method.


# 3

# Let's call a method, and pass both a string and an array as arguments and see how even though they are treated in the same way by Ruby, the results can be different.

# Study the following code and state what will be displayed...and why:

def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"    # "pumpkinsrutabaga"
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"    # ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"]
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
# "pumpkins"

puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
# ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"]


# Solution:

# Our output will look like this:

# My string looks like this now: pumpkins
# My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"]

# Why? It seems clear from the above that Ruby treats string and array arguments differently...but not so fast. Actually the arguments are treated in exactly the same way...but the results are different.

# In both cases, Ruby passes the arguments "by value", but unlike some other languages, the value that gets passed is a reference to some object. The string argument is passed to the method as a reference to an object of type String. Similarly, the array is passed to the method as a reference to an object of type Array.

# The important distinction is that while a reference is passed, the method initializes a new local variable for both the string and the array and assigns each reference to the new local variables. These are variables that only live within the scope of the method definition.

# So, if both arguments live inside the method as a new variable that stores a reference to the passed object...why don't the string and the array behave the same way in our output?

# The difference lies in what Ruby does when the program executes either a String#+= operation or an Array#<< operation.

# The String#+= operation is re-assignment and creates a new String object. The reference to this new object is assigned to a_string_param. The local variable a_string_param now points to "pumpkinsrutabaga", not "pumpkins". It has been re-assigned by the String#+= operation. This means that a_string_param and my_string no longer point to the same object.

# With the array, one array object can have any number of elements. When we attach an additional element to an array using the << operator, Ruby simply keeps using the same object that was passed in, and appends the new element to it.

# So, because the local variable an_array_param still points to the original object, the local variables my_array and an_array_param are still pointing at the same object, and we see the results of what happened to the array "outside" of the method.


# 4

# To drive that last one home...let's turn the tables and have the string show a modified output, while the array thwarts the method's efforts to modify the caller's version of it.

def tricky_method_two(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param << 'rutabaga'                  # "pumpkinsrutabaga"
  an_array_param = ['pumpkins', 'rutabaga']     # ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"]
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method_two(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
# "pumpkinsrutabaga"

puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
# ["pumpkins"]

# an_array_param is re-assigned to a new array object, ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"]. an_array_param no longer points to the same object as my_array
# the string object that a_string_param points to is mutated, which means my_string is also changed because it points to the same object.


# Solution:

# My string looks like this now: pumpkinsrutabaga
# My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins"]

# As you can see, we have achieved the opposite effect from our last example.

# We are still passing in the same two string and array arguments, but the results are the opposite, because our method does the "same thing" to each, but in a different way than before. That is, in both cases, the method attempts to change the string from "pumpkins" to "pumpkinsrutabaga" and add "rutabaga" to the array.

# Despite the similarity of the results inside the method definition, the results outside the method definition are the opposite.

# As before, the explanation is all about what Ruby does with local variables when we change the object it points to. Does it create a new local variable? Or is it able to just modify the existing object?

# With the Array#= assignment, our literal ['pumpkins', 'rutabaga'] array is a new object, and we are assigning it to the local variable an_array_param.


# 5

# Depending on a method to modify its arguments can be tricky:

def tricky_method!(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param << "rutabaga"
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"
end

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
# "pumpkinsrutabaga"

puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
# ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"]

# Whether the above "coincidentally" does what we think we wanted "depends" upon what is going on inside the method.

# How can we refactor this practice problem to make the result easier to predict and easier for the next programmer to maintain?
