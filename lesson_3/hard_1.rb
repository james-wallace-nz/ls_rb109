# In other practice problems, we have looked at how the scope of variables affects the modification of one "layer" when they are passed to another.

# To drive home the salient aspects of variable scope and modification of one scope by another, consider the following similar sets of code.

# What will be printed by each of these code groups?


# A)

def mess_with_vars(one, two, three)
  one = two
  two = three
  three = one
end

one = "one"
two = "two"
three = "three"

mess_with_vars(one, two, three)

puts "one is: #{one}"
puts "two is: #{two}"
puts "three is: #{three}"


# B)

# Ben was tasked to write a simple ruby method to determine if an input string is an IP address representing dot-separated numbers. e.g. "10.4.5.11". He is not familiar with regular expressions. Alyssa supplied Ben with a method called is_an_ip_number? that determines if a string is a numeric string between 0 and 255 as required for IP numbers and asked Ben to use it.

def dot_separated_ip_address?(input_string)
  dot_separated_words = input_string.split(".")
  while dot_separated_words.size > 0 do
    word = dot_separated_words.pop
    break unless is_an_ip_number?(word)
  end
  return true
end

# Alyssa reviewed Ben's code and says "It's a good start, but you missed a few things. You're not returning a false condition, and you're not handling the case that there are more or fewer than 4 components to the IP address (e.g. "4.5.5" or "1.2.3.4.5" should be invalid)."

Help Ben fix his code.
