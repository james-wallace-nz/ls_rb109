# Write a method that returns true if the string passed as an argument is a palindrome, false otherwise. A palindrome reads the same forward and backward. For this exercise, case matters as does punctuation and spaces.

# input: string
# output: boolean - palindrome

# palindrome reads the same forward and backward
# case sensitive
# include punctuation and spaces

# algorithim:
# conditional that argument is equal to reversed argument


def palindrome?(string)
  string == string.reverse
end

# Examples:
p palindrome?('madam') == true
p palindrome?('Madam') == false          # (case matters)
p palindrome?("madam i'm adam") == false # (all characters matter)
p palindrome?('356653') == true
